# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 
Lab 5

## Aim
To conduct face detection tasks through template-based classification and distance-based learning methods which include feature extraction work and clustering activities.

## Methodology
- Face detection through Haar Cascade classifier
- Feature extraction through HSV color space
- Feature vectors are derived from Hue and Saturation components
- K-Means clustering method groups facial features
- Template image classification through learned clusters which were developed during training

## Key Concepts
- Distance-based learning
- Feature similarity
- Unsupervised clustering
- Pattern recognition

## Results
Faces were successfully detected and grouped into clusters based on color characteristics.  
The K-Means prediction assigned the template image (Dr. Shashi Tharoor) to its nearest cluster.

## Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Face detection outputs
- Cluster visualization plots
- Template classification visualization

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrates a complete pattern recognition pipeline which includes detection processes and feature extraction activities and clustering operations and distance-based classification methods.
